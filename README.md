## Getting Started

First, run the development server for Next.js:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Similarly, Flask can be run with:

```bash
npm run flask-dev
# or
yarn flask-dev
# or
pnpm flask-dev
# or
bun flask-dev
```

And to run both concurrently:

```bash
npm run full-dev
# or
yarn full-dev
# or
pnpm full-dev
# or
bun full-dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the Next.js app.
The Flask app is available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
